 QUESTION 1 : 
 statistics is a science of collecting ,organising and analysing the data which  is used to decision making in the industry and make a conclusion ,prediction and implement models in company and industries.
 
 
 QUESTION 2 :
 There are two types of statistics -
 i) Descriptive statistics - It consist of organising and summarising the data. 
     In this we studying the mesure of central tendency like usinf the - mean , median , mode and measure of       dispersion like variance and standard deviation.
     
 ii) Inferential statistics - It consist of using data you have measured  to form conclusions . 
 In this we use some test like z-test, t-test, chi square test , and these all are under the part of hypothesis testing .
 
 
 QUESTION 3 :
 Quantitative Data: Quantitative data refers to numerical data that can be measured and expressed in terms of quantity or amounts. It involves objective measurements and numerical values. It can be further categorized into two types:

 i) Discrete Quantitative Data: Discrete quantitative data consists of individual, separate values that are usually whole numbers or counts. Examples include the number of students in a classroom, the number of cars in a parking lot, or the number of items sold.

ii) Continuous Quantitative Data: Continuous quantitative data represents measurements that can take any value within a specific range. It involves variables that can be measured on a continuous scale. Examples include temperature, weight, height, or time. Continuous data is often collected through instruments or sensors.

Qualitative Data:
Qualitative data refers to non-numerical data that captures qualities, attributes, or characteristics. It involves subjective observations, descriptions, or opinions. Qualitative data can be further categorized into two types:

i) Nominal Qualitative Data: Nominal qualitative data represents categories with no specific order or ranking. It involves variables that can be assigned to distinct groups or classes. Examples include gender (male or female), marital status (single, married, divorced), or types of animals (dog, cat, bird).

ii)Ordinal Qualitative Data: Ordinal qualitative data represents categories with a specific order or ranking. It involves variables that can be arranged in a meaningful sequence. Examples include survey responses ranging from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree," educational levels (elementary, high school, college), or rankings (1st place, 2nd place, 3rd place).

 QUESTION 5 :
 
 Levels of measurement, also known as scales of measurement, refer to the different ways in which variables can be measured or classified. The concept of levels of measurement helps determine the appropriate statistical analysis methods that can be applied to the data. There are four commonly recognized levels of measurement:

i) Nominal Level: The nominal level of measurement involves categorizing data into distinct groups or categories with no inherent order or ranking. Variables at this level are qualitative in nature. Examples include:
Eye color (categories: blue, green, brown)
Ethnicity (categories: Caucasian, African American, Asian, Hispanic)

ii) Ordinal Level: The ordinal level of measurement involves categorizing data into distinct groups or categories that have a specific order or ranking. Variables at this level retain the information about relative differences between categories but may not have equal intervals between them. Examples include:
Educational attainment (categories: high school diploma, bachelor's degree, master's degree)
Rating scales (e.g., Likert scale: strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree)

iii)Interval Level: The interval level of measurement involves variables where the differences between values are meaningful and consistent, and equal intervals exist between values. However, there is no meaningful zero point. Examples include:
Temperature measured in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit (e.g., 0Â°C does not represent an absence of temperature)
Calendar dates (e.g., the difference between January 1 and January 2 is the same as the difference between February 1 and February 2, but there is no inherent zero point)

iv) Ratio Level: The ratio level of measurement is similar to the interval level, but it includes an absolute zero point, indicating the absence of the measured quantity. Ratios between values are meaningful. Examples include:
Height in centimeters (e.g., a height of 0 cm represents no height)
Number of items owned (e.g., having zero items represents the absence of ownership)


QUESTION 6 : Understanding the level of measurement is crucial when analyzing data because it determines the types of statistical analyses and interpretations that can be applied to the data. The level of measurement indicates the properties of the data and the mathematical operations that can be performed on them.
